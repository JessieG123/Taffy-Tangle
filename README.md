## U of C CPSC 231 Fall 2018
Credit to Dr. Sonny Chan for creating this fun assignment.
## Made with:
Python 3 <br>
Booksite library from https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/code/
## Taffy Tangle:
A candy crush like game. <br>
Users match the same items to "get rid" of it and score points with each match. 
### To run Taffy Tangle:
1. Download all files from `main` and save to a folder
2. Open terminal and go into the `introcs-1.0` folder
3. Run `python setup.py install --user`
4. Run `python`
5. At the Python `>>>` prompt enter in `import stdio`. If no errors show up, it means it's successful.
6. Now step out of the folder and use the command `python p2-taffy.py` to run the game!

Note: may have to install pygame which can be done using `pip install pygame`
Note: this guide is for Windows.
